**God Hates Christians**, or at least it would seem so. Each and every day terrible things happen to and many atrocities are committed by Christians of all stripes. 

There are so many questions to be answered:

* Why does an omnipotent and omniscient god allow his followers to be harmed or killed?
* Why are their prayers seemingly unheard?
* Why do they kill their fellow man?

This blog seeks to inform about the plight of Christians around the world and god's apparent indifference to them.
